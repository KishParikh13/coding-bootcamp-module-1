Module 1 Challenge from Berkeley's Coding Bootcamp Summer 2023
**Github Pages Link**:

## Overview
This exercise was to go over the basics of accessibility standards on the web and best practices when structuring html. To do this we refactored some starter code according the below acceptance criteria.

**User Story**:
```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

```
